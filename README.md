# data-science-on-mpp
A collection of examples illustrating data processing, data science, and machine learning on the Pivotal Greenplum and HAWQ MPP databases

Examples
===========================
1. Kalman filtering using pykalman (https://pykalman.github.io/) and a PL/Python User Defined Function on noisy sensor data stored in a Greenplum or HAWQ database (see the Jupyter notebook located under the folder signal_processing)

2. An image processing example, specifically Canny edge detection using opencv (http://opencv.org/) and a PL/C User Defined Function on images stored in a Greenplum or HAWQ database (see the Jupyter notebook located under the folder image_processing)
